                Buggy the Star Clown is the captain of the Buggy Pirates and co-leader of the Buggy and Alvida Alliance. Formerly an apprentice of the Roger Pirates alongside Shanks, he was one of the earliest enemies of Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, whose actions eventually entangled him in the Summit War of Marineford. Inadvertently, the war grew his reputation enough to become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, whereupon he founded the pirate mercenary organization Buggy's Delivery. After the Warlord system was abolished, he recreated it as the Cross Guild in partnership with fellow ex-Warlords Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile. He is currently recognized as the Guild's public leader, and on its power one of the Four Emperors.<br>
                <br>
                He is the main antagonist of the Orange Town Arc and a secondary antagonist in the Loguetown Arc, as well as the central protagonist of the Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles cover arc. Since then, he has become one of the series' most-recurring characters, serving as a supporting character through the Summit War Saga in addition to tertiary appearances in the Jaya Arc, Zou Arc, Wano Country Arc, and Egghead Arc.<br>
                <br>
                He is also the main antagonist in most episodes of "Boss Luffy Historical Special". He also serves as a reluctant ally to Luffy in the 3D2Y special episode, and the movie One Piece: Stampede.
