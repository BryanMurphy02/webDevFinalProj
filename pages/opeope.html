                The Ope Ope no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit whose ability is to create a spherical domain in which the user can freely rearrange, take apart (without harm), and generally remodel the structure/anatomy of anything and anyone (themselves included) in a "surgical" way, making the user a Free Modification Human. The fruit was eaten by Trafalgar D. Water Law, having been force-fed to him by Donquixote Rosinante. Before Law, the fruit's powers were held by a certain famous doctor.<br>
                <br>
                The Ope Ope no Mi's power was first seen during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, but the fruit was not named or explained in any way until the Punk Hazard Arc.<br>
                <br>
                The Ope Ope no Mi is famed and coveted for letting the ability user perform miraculous surgeries, cure untreatable illnesses, and circumvent physical disabilities. It is also called the "Ultimate Devil Fruit" for its capacity to grant another person eternal youth in exchange for the ability user's own life, which is why the Marines were willing to pay as much as Beli5,000,000,000 to buy the fruit from a pirate named Diez Barrels over a decade ago.
