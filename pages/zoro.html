                Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a key combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, serving as one of their two swordsmen and holding the position of one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is publicly acknowledged as the right-hand man of his crew's captain, Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, Zoro is the second member to join Luffy's crew, doing so during the Romance Dawn Arc.<br>
                <br>
                Hailing from the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru. He is a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. Mastering the Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style he developed during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro ranks among the three most formidable combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, collectively known as the "Monster Trio." His aspiration is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin, Kuina.<br>
                <br>
                Noteworthy for his role in the Straw Hats and his former occupation as a bounty hunter, Zoro's significant bounty upon reaching the Sabaody Archipelago earned him a place among the eleven "Super Rookies," pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties exceeding Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. Together with the other ten Super Rookies and Marshall D. Teach, Zoro was later recognized as part of the "Worst Generation."<br>
                <br>
                Zoro's bounty initially stood at Beli60,000,000 following the Arabasta Arc. It increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident and further surged to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was raised to Beli1,111,000,000.
