                "Black Leg" Sanji, originally born as Vinsmoke Sanji, serves as the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and holds the position of one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fifth member to join the crew and the fourth to do so officially, joining at the conclusion of the Baratie Arc.<br>
                <br>
                Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom, Sanji disowned his family twiceâ€”once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he found refuge under Zeff's care as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he remained until encountering Monkey D. Luffy, who persuaded him to join his crew.<br>
                <br>
                Sanji's dream is to discover the legendary chef's paradise, All Blue, where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue converge, along with their diverse marine life. Renowned as one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, Sanji is part of the trio referred to as the "Monster Trio."<br>
                <br>
                His bounty initially stood at Beli77,000,000 for his involvement in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the conditions of his bounty were altered to "Only Alive" due to his biological father's intervention. After escaping from Big Mom's territory, his bounty reverted to "Dead or Alive" status (with the Vinsmoke name despite his disownment), with its value rising to Beli330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was further increased to Beli1,032,000,000.
