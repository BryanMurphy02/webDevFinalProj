                "God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and holds the position of one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fourth member to join the crew and the third to do so officially, joining at the conclusion of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he briefly departed the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined them at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.<br>
                <br>
                Born to Yasopp and the late Banchina, Usopp grew up in Syrup Village, where he served as the "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and formed a close bond with Kaya. After collaborating with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he received an invitation to join the crew. Despite his typical cowardice, Usopp aspires to become a courageous warrior of the sea like his father and dedicates himself daily to achieving this dream.<br>
                <br>
                Usopp first gained recognition with a bounty of Beli30,000,000 under his alter ego, Sogeking, following the events at Enies Lobby. Subsequently, after the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp received a bounty of Beli200,000,000 under his own name. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was further increased to Beli500,000,000.
