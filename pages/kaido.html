                Kaidou of the Beasts, renowned as the world's "Strongest Creature", is the Governor-General of the Beasts Pirates and was formerly one of the Four Emperors that ruled over the New World. He is also the father of Yamato.<br>
                <br>
                Once a promising child soldier at the service of the Vodka Kingdom decades ago, Kaidou was drafted against his will by the Marines but managed to escape and start a career in piracy. He was invited by Edward Newgate to join the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice, where he met and befriended Charlotte Linlin. During the God Valley Incident when the Rocks Pirates met their downfall, Linlin provided Kaidou with the rare Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu. He then went on to form his own crew and build it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government.<br>
                <br>
                After being invited to Wano Country by Kurozumi Higurashi, Kaidou joined forces with Wano Country's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi, and occupied Onigashima as his base. After a failed attempt from Kozuki Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards to overthrow him, he continued to accrue military might in Wano Country for 20 years before deciding to dispose of Orochi and proceed with his plan for the New Onigashima Project. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and the Beasts Pirates were ultimately defeated. Following Kaidou's defeat at Monkey D. Luffy's hands, the World Economy News Paper released a new listing of the Four Emperors, with Kaidou no longer being included among them anymore. After his defeat, Kaidou is now referred to in Wano's folklore retelling as "Dragon King Kaidou".
