                "Desert King" Sir Crocodile is the former president of the mysterious crime syndicate Baroque Works, formerly operating under the codename "Mr. 0". He now works as a co-leader of the Cross Guild alongside Dracule Mihawk.<br>
                <br>
                Crocodile is a former Warlord of the Sea, at the time maintaining a public facade of an ally to both the people of Arabasta Kingdom and the Marines, all while running Baroque Works in secret with the express purpose of overthrowing Arabasta via Operation Utopia. When his plot was foiled by the Straw Hat Pirates (most notably Monkey D. Luffy) and Arabasta's princess Nefertari Vivi, he was stripped of his title and imprisoned in the deepest level of the legendary prison Impel Down. His former partner and Vice-President of Baroque Works, Nico Robin, would go on to become a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.<br>
                <br>
                Crocodile was freed by Luffy from Impel Down in exchange for aiding in the rescue of his brother and went to Marineford to participate in the Summit War. While initially aiming to kill Whitebeard, his contempt for the Marines led him to ally with Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates.
