                Monkey D. Luffy, often called "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat," is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly notorious and formidable Straw Hat Pirates. Fearlessly chasing after the legendary treasure left behind by Gol D. Roger, he aims to become the new Pirate King and pursue an undisclosed dream known only to his crew and closest companions. Luffy believes that becoming the Pirate King equates to having the utmost freedom in the world.<br>
                <br>
                Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, thus carrying the enigmatic "D" legacy. His upbringing was significantly influenced by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he formed strong bonds with the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Revolutionary officer Sabo. However, his greatest inspiration stems from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who inadvertently granted him the ability to consume the Devil Fruit that transformed his body into rubber, saved his life by sacrificing an arm, and bestowed upon him his iconic straw hat as a symbol of their promise to meet again once Luffy became a renowned pirate.<br>
                <br>
                As a pirate, Luffy has boldly opposed numerous regional, national, and global powers, starting from various established East Blue pirates to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has emerged victorious over many adversaries, including infiltrating and indirectly causing the downfall of Enies Lobby, escaping the seemingly impregnable Impel Down, influencing pivotal events during the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. Additionally, Luffy possesses a remarkable ability to attract friends and allies, having personally recruited every member of his crew and earning respect and gratitude from numerous nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.
