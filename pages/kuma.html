                Bartholomew Kuma is a former Warlord of the Sea, the former king of the Sorbet Kingdom, and an officer and founding member of the Revolutionary Army with a bounty of Beli296,000,000. As a pirate, Kuma sailed the seas as a single-person pirate crew. He is also the adoptive father of Jewelry Bonney, daughter of his late friend and fellow revolutionary Ginny. Kuma is a member of the near-extinct special race known as the Buccaneers, inherited from his late father Clapp.<br>
                <br>
                Because of the lies the World Government told the public, Kuma became feared as an extremely vicious pirate, earning himself the title "Tyrant". In exchange for curing Bonney of the deadly Sapphire Scales disease, Kuma became a special type of cyborg known as a "Pacifista", developed by the world-renowned scientist Vegapunk. Once Vegapunk finished his modifications on Kuma, the Warlord was converted into the first complete Pacifista cyborg, with the serial PX-0, and mentally died in the process. Vegapunk also cloned Kuma as S-Bear, one of the Seraphim that were designed to replace the Warlords.<br>
                <br>
                Kuma has been enslaved by the World Nobles twice in his lifetime: The first time was in his infancy until he escaped during the God Valley Incident and the second time in adulthood as punishment for the two years he spent protecting the Thousand Sunny and lasted until his fellow revolutionaries freed him during the most recent Levely.
