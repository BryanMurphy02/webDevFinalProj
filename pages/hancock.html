                "Pirate Empress" Boa Hancock is the captain of the Kuja Pirates and was the only female Warlord of the Sea before the organization's disbandment. She is the current empress, known as the "Snake Princess", of Amazon Lily and rules over the Kuja tribe with her two younger sisters, Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold.<br>
                <br>
                Kidnapped by the World Nobles as a child along with her sisters, she was enslaved and tortured for years; during this time she was force-fed the Mero Mero no Mi, which gives her the ability to turn both living and non-living things into stone. She and her sisters escaped from Mary Geoise during a mass breakout instigated by Fisher Tiger. She was returned to her home with the help of Gloriosa, Silvers Rayleigh and Shakuyaku, where she would eventually become the island's empress, as well as one of the Seven Warlords.<br>
                <br>
                Though initially antagonistic towards Monkey D. Luffy, his selfless actions and animosity towards the Celestial Dragons caused her to befriend, and eventually fall in love, with him. She went on to serve as one of Luffy's most stalwart allies, helping him infiltrate Impel Down, siding with him in the Summit War of Marineford, providing him a location to train on for two years, and then helping him reunite with his crew and supporting him from afar.
