                "Flame Emperor" Sabo serves as the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army, holding the esteemed position of No. 2 within the organization, second only to Supreme Commander Monkey D. Dragon. He is also the sworn brother of the notorious pirates Monkey D. Luffy and the late Portgas D. Ace.<br>
                <br>
                Born into nobility to parents Outlook III and Didit in the Goa Kingdom, Sabo fled his affluent upbringing at the age of 10 with aspirations of becoming a pirate and chronicling his adventures in a book. While living as a vagabond in Gray Terminal, he crossed paths with Ace and Luffy. Attempting to set sail shortly thereafter to escape his family, Sabo's ship was destroyed by the World Noble Saint Jalmack. Saved by Dragon but losing his memory in the process, Sabo dedicated himself to the service of the Revolutionary Army. However, his memories resurfaced a decade later upon learning of Ace's demise. Two years after regaining his memories, Sabo reunited with Luffy and inherited Ace's legacy by consuming his Devil Fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi. Presently, he holds a bounty of Beli602,000,000.<br>
                <br>
                Sabo allies with Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc and plays a pivotal role in the films One Piece Film: Gold and One Piece: Stampede.
