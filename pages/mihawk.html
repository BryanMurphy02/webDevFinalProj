                Dracule "Hawk Eyes" Mihawk is a world-famous pirate who holds the title of "Strongest Swordsman in the World". He is one of the founders of Cross Guild and was formerly one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, being the first revealed and formally introduced, until the group's dissolution.<br>
                <br>
                In the past, Mihawk was known as the "Marine Hunter" and had a reputation for being the rival of Shanks, one of the Four Emperors. His place of residence was Kuraigana Island, where he served during the two-year timeskip as Roronoa Zoro's master in his swordsmanship training. Alongside his former Warlord colleague, Crocodile, Mihawk created an organization known as the Cross Guild, with Buggy of the Four Emperors acting as the organization's figurehead leader. Vegapunk also cloned Mihawk as one of the Seraphim, S-Hawk, to replace the Warlords.<br>
                <br>
                Due to his status and title, Mihawk is viewed by Zoro as the ultimate obstacle to achieve his dream of becoming the world's strongest swordsman himself. Mihawk can be considered a supporting antagonist of the Baratie Arc and one of the major antagonists in the Marineford Arc, where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford on the side of the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords of the Sea.
