                Trafalgar D. Water Law, more commonly known as just Trafalgar Law and by his epithet as the "Surgeon of Death", is a pirate from the North Blue and the captain and doctor of the Heart Pirates. He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation". He became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea during the timeskip, but his position was revoked for allying with the Straw Hat Pirates. Law, like many other pirates, dreams of finding the One Piece, while also desiring to know the purpose of the Will of D.<br>
                <br>
                Law is the only known survivor of Flevance, a town whose inhabitants suffered from a condition known as Amber Lead Syndrome. Because the disease was fatal and poorly understood, Flevance was destroyed by neighboring countries out of fear, including Law's parents and his younger sister, with a young Law barely escaping alive. He subsequently joined the Donquixote Pirates, where Donquixote Doflamingo intended to make Law one of his executive officers. However, thanks to the efforts of Doflamingo's brother, Rosinante, Law was freed from the Donquixote Pirates' influence and became a pirate set to bring down Doflamingo's empire.<br>
                <br>
                During the timeskip, his bounty increased from Beli200,000,000 to Beli440,000,000 before it was frozen due to his induction into the Seven Warlords of the Sea. However, after having his title revoked during the events of the Dressrosa Arc, Law's bounty was reinstated and raised to Beli500,000,000. Eventually, his bounty would be raised to Beli3,000,000,000 for his role in taking down Big Mom of the Four Emperors alongside Eustass Kid during the Wano Country Arc.
