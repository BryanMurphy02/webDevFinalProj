                Gecko Moria is the captain of the Thriller Bark Pirates and a former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who resides on Thriller Bark, the largest ship in the world. His bounty is Beli320,000,000, which was frozen until he lost his Warlord position.<br>
                <br>
                In his youth, Moria served as captain of the Gecko Pirates until a vast majority of its members were killed in a fight against Kaidou of the Four Emperors. This traumatic event led Moria to seek power through an army of zombies, constructed by his subordinate, Dr. Hogback.<br>
                <br>
                He is the main antagonist of the Thriller Bark Saga who stole the shadows of Brook and various other beings with Kage Kage no Mi powers. He is also a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords.<br>
                <br>
                After the end of the war, he was stripped of his title and was to be eliminated by Donquixote Doflamingo, but he managed to escape into the New World. Vegapunk later cloned Moria as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords. Two years after the war, he attacked the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu, only to be imprisoned, but he was assumed to be rescued by Perona with the help of Koby later on.
