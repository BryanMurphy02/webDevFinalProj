                Sakazuki, formerly known by his Admiral alias Akainu, is the current Fleet Admiral of the Marines, succeeding the previous Fleet Admiral, Sengoku. During the first half of the series, he was one of the three Admirals, and was the last one out of the three to debut. Upon becoming the Fleet Admiral, one of Sakazuki's first decisions was to relocate Marine Headquarters into the New World in preparation for the New Pirate Age.<br>
                <br>
                In the manga, Akainu was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. In the anime, he was mentioned earlier by Vice Admiral Jonathan during the anime-only G-8 Arc, which aired after Akainu had been revealed in the manga.<br>
                <br>
                Sakazuki is perhaps the strictest follower of Absolute Justice in the entire series, to the point where his extremism prompted his fellow Admiral Aokiji to oppose his promotion to Fleet Admiral and resign from the Marines after this effort failed. Because of his actions, Sakazuki is one of the three main antagonists of the Marineford Arc alongside Sengoku and Marshall D. Teach, among the major antagonists in the Final Saga, and, after his promotion, he currently serves as a very prominent antagonist for the remainder of the series.
