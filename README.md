# Punk Records: One Piece Wiki

Welcome to Punk Records, a One Piece Wiki where you can explore information about characters, devil fruits, and organizations in the world of One Piece.

## Overview
For our web development class's final project, we decided to try and tackle a wiki. We chose the theme of One Piece and must give credit to how much inspiration we took from the official wiki. The intent of this project was to develop an acceptable final project whilst having fun implementing an idea we have interest in. Hence, the closer similarities to the official site will not be claimed as an idea completely thought of on our own. Some of the categories listed below are simply for show and have no functionality. If we were to continue developing this project then they would certainly have functionality in the near future.

Punk Records is a comprehensive online resource dedicated to providing fans of the One Piece series with detailed information about various aspects of the fictional world created by Eiichiro Oda. From character profiles to devil fruit abilities, our website aims to be your go-to destination for all things One Piece.

## Features

- **Character Profiles**: Discover detailed profiles of your favorite One Piece characters, including biographical information, abilities, and affiliations.

- **Devil Fruits**: Explore the fascinating world of devil fruits and learn about their unique powers and users.

- **Organizations**: Learn about the different organizations and groups that play significant roles in the One Piece universe.

- **Search Functionality**: We were unable to successfully add a serach feature. Although, we were certainly close. It appears as if our current implementation finds the pages with the searched word, but is unable to display the content properly. This feature would certainly be next on the list of things to do.
